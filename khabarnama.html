        <h1 id="IHC"> Islamabad High Court </h1>
        <p> The Islamabad High Court on Wednesday observed visible contradictions in government’s policies to stem the
            spread of the coronavirus in the country.
            <br />
            A single-bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah made the observation while hearing a petition
            challenging the government’s decision to ban indoor weddings.
            <br />
            Justice Minallah said the current wave of infections was more serious and needed extreme caution. Noting
            that the UK police have been authorised to penalise those violating COVID-19 SOPs, he said it was the
            government’s responsibility to ensure enforcement of the safety guidelines.
            <br />
            “The coronavirus claimed lives of your father and Peshawar High Court (PHC) chief justice Waqar Seth,” he
            said, addressing petitioner’s counsel Sardar Taimoor Aslam. “We should voluntarily shut down everything.”
            <br />
            To which, Aslam replied that Prime Minister Imran Khan had directed against closing down businesses.
            <br />
            The hearing was also attended by Attorney General of Pakistan Khalid Javed Khan, Additional Attorney General
            Tariq Khokhar, and Deputy Attorney General Tayyab Shah.
            <br />
            “We cannot ignore the coronavirus situation,” said Khan. “For us, it is saving lives versus saving
            livelihoods. A complete shutdown is easy but we are not headed that way. The decision will be taken by the
            federal and provincial governments.”
            <br />
            The judge observed that the petition was filed when the government itself was non-serious about the issue.
            Noting the COVID-19 SOP violations during electioneering ahead of the polls in Gilgit Baltistan, he said the
            situation was “worrying”.
            <br />
            “This is why the premier postponed his jalsa,” said Khan. The judge noted that it “is the poor people who
            bear the brunt. The rich have access to facilities”.
            <br />
            Justice Minallah expressed dismay at the Parliament not playing its due role despite one of its members
            dying due to the coronavirus. “We have high expectations from the Parliament. We don’t know what the future
            holds. No one seems to think that they can be next [victim of COVID-19].”
            <br />
            The judge said it was time for all political forces to unite against the virus. “Extraordinary circumstances
            call for extraordinary leadership,” he observed.
            <br />
            “We trust the experts’ opinion and government measures. You and I both need to follow the COVID-19 SOPs,”
            said Justice Minallah.
            <br />
            The court disposed of the petition. </p>

        <h1 id="KCR"> Karachi Circular Railway </h1>
        <p> Pakistan Railway officials on Wednesday said that the Karachi Circular Railway's original route has been
            changed as arrangements are not yet complete for it to resume as per the initial plan.
            <br />
            Originally, the first KCR train was scheduled to depart from the Orangi station at 7am on November 19,
            followed by subsequent departures at 10am, 1pm, and 4pm, and was to move between Orangi and Pipri.

            <br />
            The distance between both stations is 60 kilometres and includes Landhi, Malir, Drigh Road, Cantt, City,
            Kemari, Wazir Mansion, Lyari, Gulbai, Site, and Shah Abdul Latif.
            <br />
            The KCR will now move between Pipri and City station, officials said on Wednesday. It will not travel
            between Orangi and City stations as planned, as the 14-km long track between the two could not be cleared.
            <br />
            "Railway engineers and experts have not given a clearance for the 14-km track," the officials said, adding:
            "Level crossing on the 14-km route to Orangi station is a big problem."
            <br />
            Meanwhile, sources said that the train cannot travel at more than 35km/h on the 14-km track.
            <br />
            According to the sources, the trains are not in the condition required to travel at 50km/h.
            <br />
            The railway management shall make the circular train operational on the 14-km track between December 15 and
            30, while from tomorrow, November 19, a 46-km track will be functional.
            <br />
            The KCR is set to resume operations after two decades.
            <br />
            It has two locomotives and 11 coaches — each with the capacity to transport 100 passengers, 64 on seats and
            36 standing.
            <br />
            A uniform fare of Rs50 per travel has also been fixed.</p>
